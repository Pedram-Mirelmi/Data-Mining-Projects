# This homework consists of 2 parts with 2 different datasets:
## The first part:
#### The link to the dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Maternal+Health+Risk+Data+Set)
### This parts has these steps:
-  Encoding the categorical columns of the dataset
-  Shuffling the data and splitting it into training and test data with the ratio of 30-70
-  Do preprocessing
-  Use Decision-tree, KNN, SVM, and random forest to train the data with cross-validation method and report the results and plot the confusion matrix
## The Second part:
#### The link to the dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson%27s+Disease+Classification)
### This part also has the same steps and some extra steps:
-  spliting the labels and features
-  shuffling and spliting train and test data into 30-70
-  Do preprocessings...
-  train the same models and use cross-validation method and report the results and plot the confusion matrix ...
-  Do feature extraction with PCA and repeate the previous steps and report the results
