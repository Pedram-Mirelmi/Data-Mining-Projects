# The Final project also uses neural network to classify the dataset which consists of 400 pictures of Grapevine leaves of 4 types(100 per each)
You can Download the dataset from here(400MB):https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/Grapevine_Leaves_Image_Dataset.zip
### Here are the steps:
-   Split the dataset into train and test with the ratio of 20-80
-   Use data-augmentation to generate more data samples and reduce the details of each picture to prevent overfitting
-   Use different pretrained CNN models (keras) to do the classification
-   Use 10-fold-cross-validation to make the results fair
-   Report the results
